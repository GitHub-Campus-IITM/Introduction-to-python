## ‚ú® How does this benefit your community?
Freshies have recently joined our college recently, we haven't planned any event for complete beginners, so this time let's show them some pathway and opportunities with basic coding. We chose python because it's very human readable.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è What help do you need with this event?
We are having a follow up with a contest for UG Freshies so we need prizes for this event.
